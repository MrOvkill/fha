FHA Hashing Algorithm
===

<br />
The FHA Hashing Algorithm is designed to create hashes of files and strings completely<br />
One of it's biggest advantages is that it uses 4096-byte SALTs to make the hashes.<br />
It's ideal for password storage, as cracking it with a bruteforce algorithm would take the time it takes to crack a MD5 password to the power of 4096.<br />
